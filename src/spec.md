# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add shopping and location-related learning content to expand conversation practice and cultural knowledge.

**Planned changes:**
- Add 3-5 new conversation scenarios per language focused on shopping interactions (finding malls, locating shops, asking for directions, inquiring about nearby stores)
- Add 2-3 new culture entries per language covering shopping customs, marketplace traditions, and commercial areas in African cultures
- Integrate new shopping-related units into the learning path as unlockable nodes

**User-visible outcome:** Users can practice shopping-related conversations and learn about marketplace customs and shopping etiquette across all 6 supported African languages through new unlockable units in their learning path.
