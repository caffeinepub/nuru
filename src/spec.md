# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the Nuru mascot visuals with realistic versions and make learning-path content immersive by presenting culture and conversation prompts primarily in the selected target language.

**Planned changes:**
- Create new realistic versions of the mascot head and waving mascot images without overwriting existing files.
- Update the frontend to use the new realistic mascot images wherever the mascot appears (at minimum: header mascot head and dashboard hero waving mascot) while keeping layout/sizing unchanged.
- Update seeded/static learning-path content so culture entries and conversation practice prompts are written primarily in the target language for each currently seeded language (no schema changes).

**User-visible outcome:** The app shows a more realistic Nuru mascot in the header and dashboard, and the Learning Path modal displays culture content and conversation prompts primarily in the chosen target language instead of English.
