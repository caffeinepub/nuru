# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand learning content with additional units for all languages and extend minigame duration.

**Planned changes:**
- Add 3-5 additional conversation scenarios and culture entries for each of the 6 African languages
- Organize new content into 2-3 additional learning path units per language
- Increase minigame time limits by at least 50% across all difficulty levels
- Increase the number of questions/items per minigame session

**User-visible outcome:** Users can access more learning units for each language and experience longer minigame sessions with more questions and extended time limits.
